        <p>Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Just beat
          the devil out of it. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these
          little delicate things. All those little son of a guns. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long
          way. Be brave. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. Imagination is the key to painting. I
          will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Everyone wants to
          enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. We start with a vision in our heart, and we
          put it on canvas. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. This painting comes right out of your
          heart. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is
          everywhere, you only have to look to see it. I guess that would be considered a UFO.</p>
